# KingShell

This is just a program which I made in my class, to simulate a linux Shell;

# Commands

<ul>
  <li>help -> It shows a list of built-in commands on standard output;</li>
  <li>sair/exit/quit NUMBER -> It shutdowns the program after X seconds (if you just write "quit", it will be shutdown after 3 seconds;</li>
  <li>cd -> It changes your current directory;</li>
<ul>
